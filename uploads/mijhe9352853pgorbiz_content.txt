This is a test document for the RAG system.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. It works by:

1. Retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. Using those documents as context for the language model
3. Generating responses that are grounded in the retrieved information

This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, factual responses.
